        <P>
            is it odd that a little San Francisco coffeehouse takes its inspiration from a majestic public library many thousands of miles away in Paris? Perhaps. <br> Or perhaps such special, intrinsic, richly felt connections are at the very heart of inspiration in the first place. <br>

            When we set out to conceive of a new cafe <br> where people have access to the best coffee and light fare, we were entranced by the story of the Bibliothèque Mazarine. <br> The very first public library in France, the Bibliothèque was opened to scholars in 1643. Its legacy lives on as a symbol of French culture, democracy, and taste. <br>
            
            The idea that an artfully assembled collection might serve the public good struck a deep chord with us. <br> We treat with curatorial zeal each new coffee that we source from the most accomplished roasters, <br> and regularly update our menu of food and beverages in response to our customers’ interests. <br> We believe that our efforts can inspire a preference for Mazarine as a destination for the finest coffee and food, <br> a setting for engaging conversations with friends and colleagues, and a place that you can always call home.
