        <P>
            is it odd that a little San Francisco coffeehouse takes its inspiration from a majestic public library many thousands of miles away in Paris? Perhaps. Or perhaps such special, intrinsic, richly felt connections are at the very heart of inspiration in the first place.

            When we set out to conceive of a new cafe where people have access to the best coffee and light fare, we were entranced by the story of the Bibliothèque Mazarine. The very first public library in France, the Bibliothèque was opened to scholars in 1643. Its legacy lives on as a symbol of French culture, democracy, and taste.
            
            The idea that an artfully assembled collection might serve the public good struck a deep chord with us. We treat with curatorial zeal each new coffee that we source from the most accomplished roasters, and regularly update our menu of food and beverages in response to our customers’ interests. We believe that our efforts can inspire a preference for Mazarine as a destination for the finest coffee and food, a setting for engaging conversations with friends and colleagues, and a place that you can always call home.
